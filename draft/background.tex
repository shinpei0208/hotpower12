\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:background}

GPU technology has continued to enhance computing capabilities with
highly parallel architectures.
NVIDIA GPUs, for example, have integrated on a chip about 250 cores in
2008, 500 cores in 2010, and 1500 cores in 2012.
Beyond the number of processing cores, recent GPUs implement
hierarchical cache boosting memory performance in the presence of
thousands of threads.
The resulting peak performance of NVIDIA's latest architecture,
\textit{a.k.a., Kepler}, exceeds 3GFlops and its performance-per-watt
reaches 16GFlops.
All these advantages of GPUs are made available for general-purpose
applications due to emerging programming frameworks, such as CUDA and
OpenCL.
